1. **Prime Check:**  
   Write a Java program to check whether a given number is a **prime number**.

2. **Prime Range:**  
   Write a program to print all **prime numbers within a given range** specified by the user.

3. **Armstrong Number Check:**  
   Write a program to check if a given number is an **Armstrong number**.  
   *(An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits. Example: 153 = 1Â³ + 5Â³ + 3Â³)*

4. **Fibonacci Series:**
